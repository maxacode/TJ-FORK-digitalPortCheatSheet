# digitalPortCheatSheet
## A novel attempt at a Python-based Port Cheat Sheet. 
-------------------------------------------------------
So, this project was born from a lab in the Python module of ThriveDX's CyberDefense Professional Program. The original lab had you create a dictionary and ask the user which service they wanted to know the port for, and it would return the port number. The lab documentation only had 6 or so services listed, so I set out to see if anyone had already built a dict of at least well-known ports. 

My google results turned me on to two functions within the **socket** module, **getservbyname** and **getservbyport**. These modules were perfect for what I wanted to do. After some talk with my instructors, I decided that this would be a perfect opprotunity to mess around with tkinter.
